# books

This web app is designed to keep a list of what books
I'm interested in reading (and, perhaps more importantly,
have already read), so that I can pull it up when I'm
at a used book store or the library and can't quite
remember if the book I'm holding is one that I intend to
read or already have read.

It's true purpose was for me to learn [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org),
the excellent Python web "microframework". As such, 
I make no promises as to correctness, efficiency, visual
appeal (especially), or security (most importantly).

It's actually intended to be general--there's another
module for tracking breads that I've baked in an attempt
to arrive at the One True Loaf, but I've let that lapse
(largely because the [Tartine Country Bread](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016277-tartines-country-bread)
is as close to that as I will get).

Note also that this shares authentication with t2, because
I was hosting it on the same machine as t2 and figured
I might as well. So that's kind of a barrier to anyone
else wanting to use it. But it can be fixed. :)
